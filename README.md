A python library for extracting knowledge from raw sources.

## Architecture :triangular_ruler:

This library is built on top of an information extraction pipeline which performs the following functions:

`Pipeline` is the main protocol which defines how the various nodes in the pipeline interact and keeps track of the state of the analysis. It is responsible for taking in the raw media and outputting a document with the extracted information. The inbuilt pipelines are:

|Name|Functionality                                                         |
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Full|Runs all the nodes in the pipeline for optimal information extraction.|

`Normaliser` is the protocol which nodes use to define ways to refine the raw media so it can be easily processed down the line. It takes the raw media as an input and outputs the same raw media with the processing applied to it.

|Name       |Functionality                                                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|english    |Checks if the text is in english, or if it isn't provide translation to english if it is a supported language.|
|coreference|Resolves pronouns to their intended reference entity.                                                         |
|blink      |Links the entities mentioned in the document to global identifiers.                                           |

`Extractor` is the protocol which nodes use to extract information in clearly defined ways (such as `Triple`). These are responsible for producing as much information as possible from the raw media.

|Name   |Functionality                                                                      |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|svo    |Finds subject verb object triples in the text (rule based approach).               |
|openie |Finds relationships between entities with attributes.                              |
|opennre|Finds structured relationships between entities (such as father).                  |
|llm    |Finds relationships between entities using large language model attention matrices.|

`Reducer` is the protocol which nodes use to remove and deduplicate the information extracted previously so it is presented to the user of the library cleanly.

|Name        |Functionality                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|coreference |Remove any triples with a pronoun as their entity.            |
|ner         |Remove any triples where both entities are not named entities.|
|subjectivity|Remove any triples representing a subjective opinion.         |

Right now there are no efforts to use accelerated versions of these models, so unfortunately the library is slow. In the future CUDA and other acceleration efforts will be supported as well as FAISS databases.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

When installing on MacOS, make sure you have the following installed:

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Make sure you install the following packages on brew:

```shell
$ brew install openblas rust cmake wget
```

To install from pypi:

```shell
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
$ pip install pyiextract
```

## Usage example :eyes:

To run the full pipeline as intended simply create a `FullPipeline` object and run the extract on it. Note that on the first run the library will attempt to download all the required models (which takes a while).

```python
import json

from pyiextract import fullpipeline

pipeline = fullpipeline.FullPipeline()
doc = pipeline.extract("Paul Allen was born on January 21, 1953, in Seattle, Washington, to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye Allen. Allen attended Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle, where he befriended Bill Gates, two years younger, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers. Paul and Bill used a teletype terminal at their high school, Lakeside, to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems.")
print(json.dumps([str(x) for x in doc.triples()]))
```

This produces the following:
```json

## TODO

1. Filter junk triples (use ML with G2V).
2. Deduplicate triples (use ML with G2V).
3. Create a training mode that can be used to fine-tune the underlying models.
